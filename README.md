# AI-Powered Autonomous Penetration Testing Agent

An advanced AI-driven cybersecurity tool that autonomously performs comprehensive penetration testing using reinforcement learning to improve attack strategies over time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Autonomous Reconnaissance**: Automated target discovery and information gathering
- **Intelligent Vulnerability Scanning**: AI-powered vulnerability detection and assessment
- **Automated Exploitation**: Smart exploit selection and execution
- **Privilege Escalation**: Post-exploitation capabilities with AI guidance
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuously improves attack strategies based on success rates
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed attack paths with remediation advice
- **Ethical Safeguards**: Built-in safety mechanisms and authorization controls

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This tool is designed for **authorized security testing only**. Users must:
- Have explicit permission to test the target systems
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Use only on systems they own or have written authorization to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

**The developers are not responsible for any misuse of this tool.**

   ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from core.agent import PentestAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = PentestAgent(
    target="example.com",
    scope=["web", "network"],
    max_depth=3
)

# Run autonomous penetration test
results = agent.run_autonomous_test()

# Generate report
agent.generate_report("pentest_report.html")
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Start the API server
python api/main.py

# Run a test via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "example.com", "scope": ["web"]}'
```

## 📊 AI Components

### Reinforcement Learning Agent
- **Environment**: Custom gym environment simulating penetration testing scenarios
- **Algorithm**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for stable learning
- **Rewards**: Based on successful exploits, privilege escalation, and data access
- **State Space**: Target information, discovered vulnerabilities, current access level
- **Action Space**: Available exploits, reconnaissance techniques, privilege escalation methods

### Strategy Optimization
- **Attack Path Planning**: AI-driven selection of optimal attack sequences
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligent distribution of testing resources
- **Adaptive Techniques**: Dynamic adjustment based on target responses

## 🔧 Configuration
